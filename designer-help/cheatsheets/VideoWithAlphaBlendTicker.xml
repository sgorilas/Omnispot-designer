      <description>
         Open the <b>File &gt; New... </b> file menu item. Select the <b>Designer &gt; Designer Editor File</b> wizard, and follow the instructions to create a new deployment file with a resolution of 800x600.

The new deployment will open in the deployment editor. This is a multi page editor. There are tabs at the bottom of the editor that allow you to move between the various pages of the editor. The first page displays a list of layouts specified for the deployment. There is a separate page for each layout with the graphical contents of that layout.

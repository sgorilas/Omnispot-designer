<h1>Prerequisites</h1>
<p>The Omni-Spot Designer is a standalone application. As long as a Java runtime
environment is available it should function properly as far as the designing of Omni-Spot
deployment descriptors and their export for usage by the rest of the system.</p>
<p>In order for the deployment preview to work correctly, the VLC player must be
installed on the machine and the path to directory where VLC is installed must be added
to the <em>PATH</em> environment variable. Both these actions are described below.</p>
<h3>Installing the VLC player</h3>
<p>You can find the latest VLC player installer
<a href="http://www.videolan.org/vlc/">here</a>.</p>
<h3>Adding to the PATH environment variable</h3>
<p>After you have installed the VLC player, you must add the path to directory where
VLC is installed to the <em>PATH</em> environment variable. To do this bring up the
system properties page for the computer (either right clicking on the computer icon and
selecting properties, or from the control panel). Select the <em>Advanced</em> tab in the
System Properties window. This should look like this:</p>

</center>
<p>Click on the <em>Environment Variable</em> button. The environment variables editor
should show up:</p>

</center>
<p>On the <em>System Variables</em> section select the <em>Path</em> system variable
and click on the <em>Edit</em> button below. It will bring an editor for changing the
value of the <em>Path</em> environment variable. At the end of the variable's value
append a semicolon followed by the path to VLC installation directory (usually 
C:\Program Files\VideoLAN\VLC). Click <em>OK</em> on all the editors and dialogs to
make your changes take effect.</p>

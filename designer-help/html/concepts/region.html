<h1><img src="../../icons/folder.png" alt="(image)" />&nbsp;&nbsp;Region</h1>
<p>A <em>region</em> is a root container of components. Typically a region will contain
a single component (such as a video component).</p>
<p>A region has a set of properties that can be modified in the property sheet
view. These are:</p>
<ul>
	<li><b>Name:</b> A name for the region. This is only used in the designer and in error
	reporting.</li>
	<li><b>Transparent:</b> A boolean that specifies if the region is to allow its
	contained components to have an invisible background. This requires the cooperation
	of the contained components. Currently only the ticker component supports this
	functionality.</li>
	<li><b>Background Color:</b> Specifies the background color of the region. This will
	only show through if the region is not fully covers by contained components.</li>
	<li><b>Location:</b> The location of the region.</li>
	<li><b>Size:</b> The size of the region.</li>
</ul>
<p>A region cannot overstep the boundaries of the deployment for which it is defined.</p>

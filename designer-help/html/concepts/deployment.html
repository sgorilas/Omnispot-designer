<p>A <em>deployment</em> or <em>deployment descriptor</em> is an XML file that defines
which resources, will be played by what components and with what properties by the
Omni-Spot Player. It refers to the resources that will be used (videos, images, flash
objects, etc.) but does not contain them.</p>
<p>When a deployment descriptor is ready to be published to the players, it must be
saved, and the "export for publishing" process must be followed. This generates a zip
file on a user supplied location that contains the deployment descriptor and all the
resources it uses. This file can then be uploaded to the Omni-Spot Administration
Console, so that it can be distributed to the Players selected by the user.</p>
<p>A deployment has a set of properties that can be modified in the property sheet
view. These are:</p>
<ul>
	<li><b>Bit Depth:</b> Specifies the number of bits that will be used for colors.</li>
	<li><b>Size:</b> The size of the deployment in pixels.</li>
	<li><b>ID:</b> A unique identifier for the deployment. This is automatically generated
	by the designer and is not editable. It is used by the Omni-Spot system to
	track individual deployments.</li>
	<li><b>Start Time:</b> The time after which the deployment should start playing. The
	usage for this property is when one wants to deploy something to the players, but not
	start playing it until some later point in time.</li>
</ul>
<p>A deployment also contains a list of <a href="layout.html">layouts</a>. When deployed
(and assuming no cron expressions have been specified) the player will start showing these
layouts in order.</p>

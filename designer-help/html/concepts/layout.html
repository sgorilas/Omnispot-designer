<h1><img src="../../icons/display.png" alt="(image)" />&nbsp;&nbsp;Layout</h1>
<p>A <em>layout</em> represents a particular arrangement of components on the screen. It
observes the notion of <em>duration</em> and <em>completion</em>. It also is associated
with a cron expression for scheduling purposes. A layout is termed to
have completed either when its duration has expired, or any one of its components has
completed. When a layout completes, the next layout in the list of layouts in its
deployment will start. The only exception to this rule is that if the cron expression
of a layout fires, then that layout will start immediately, irrespective of whether the
currently running layout has completed or not.</p>
<p>A layout has a set of properties that can be modified in the property sheet
view. These are:</p>
<ul>
	<li><b>Cron Expression:</b> Specifies the cron expression that is associated with
	the layout. If empty, then there is no trigger associated with the layout, and it
	can only run if its turn comes in the normal scheme of things.</li>
	<li><b>Duration:</b> The duration (in seconds) of the layout. If the layout runs longer
	than this amount of seconds, it is deemed to have completed.</li>
	<li><b>Name:</b> A name for the layout. This is only used in the designer and in error
	reporting.</li>
</ul>
<p>A layout also contains a list of <a href="region.html">regions</a>. The ordering of the
list specifies the z-ordering of the regions in case of overlaps (the last region in this
list overlaps any preceding regions that happen to have common areas.</p>
